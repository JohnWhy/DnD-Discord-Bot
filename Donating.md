# How to Donate
* First, join this server - https://discord.gg/XhtCeH9
* Then, in any channel, type "donate" and you will be given a unique link to follow.
* You can donate there, and you will be granted a special role on that server automatically (or should anyway) and I'll be alerted.
* Once I'm alerted, I can add your donation benefits with a quick and easy command.

This process will eventually be automated.
