# Experiencing Downtime / slowdowns?
## Here's what to do

* Firstly, check to make sure the bot is online, and it's presence isn't set to something like "updating" or "loading" which may indicate the bot is being worked on.
     * Usually you'll just need to wait this out and wait for the bot to go back to normal presence, usually with new features!
* If the bot appears to be online, with a normal version / info presence, try using !info and see what the ping time is.
    * Usually if the ping time is >200-300ms (or showing negative values*) this **may** be indicative of API slowdowns, you can confirm that here: https://status.discordapp.com/
    * * Negative ping values are not always an issue: discord uses multiple servers to send messages, sometimes they are not in sync and ping values are not accurate to what they should be.  
* If the ping is high, but the status for discordapp appears to be normal
    * Get in touch with AmericanLegend#6969 or join here: https://discord.gg/XhtCeH9
    * This means that the internet connection for the bot itself is at issue.
* If everything appears normal, but commands are still taking longer than usual
    * This could be indicative of an attack on the bot, get in touch with AmericanLegend#6969 and let him know the bot is slowed down with normal ping.
